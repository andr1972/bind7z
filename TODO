- Post a issue for p7zip: core dump if referencing not existing archive item (index out of range).
  For example: GetProperty(10000000, 3). Extract function is also affected.

- Post a issue for 7zip/p7zip: extracting empty files from LZH archive (method 6, 7)

- Test extracting encrypted archive where different password for different files are used.

- Offer a source package without tests

- Repack XAR (bz2) tests with new version of xar

- In JavaDoc of ArchiveFormat: add columns (single file tests and multiple files tests)

- Add privileged initialization of the native part. See forum "Help"

- Add to integration tests
  - Test, that the release and not the debug compilation of the binary was used to build each platform jar


Minor TODOs:
- Write more tests, for example, extracting archive with two files encrypted with different password.
- Test some untested archive formats
- Support more archive formats
- Write documentation / improve javadoc
- Improve Web site


Major TODOs:
- Implement archive creation
- Move to version 9.X of 7-zip/p7zip
